# Multithreaded TreeHash calculator for AWS Glacier

Hi!

The original calculation algorithm was taken from the [AWS Documentation site](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html) _(Example 1: Java Example)_
I just made it to run in the multithreaded mode.

Best regards,\
